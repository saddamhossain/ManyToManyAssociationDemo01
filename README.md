# Many To Many Association Demo 01

Design a system for a university where students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can be taken by many students (many-to-many relationship). The system should track the enrollment information, including the course details, student details, and the date of enrollment. Alos implement functionality to manage enrollments, ensuring that no course exceeds a maximum number of students.

# Requirements:

Each student should have a name and an ID.

Each course should have a title, a unique code, and a number of credits.

The system should allow students to enroll in courses and record the enrollment date.

Implement a collection that manages enrollments, with a maximum number of students allowed per course.

Display the list of students enrolled in each course.

# Constraints:

The system should enforce the maximum number of students per course.

Console output should only be in the main program class.
